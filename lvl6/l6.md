### Environment Variable Configuration: 

```
# PRODUCTION
NODE_ENV=production
PROD_USERNAME=postgres
PROD_PASSWORD=ravi
PROD_DATABASE=todo
PROD_HOST=db
PROD_DIALECT=postgres

# DEVLOPMENT
DEV_USERNAME=postgres
DEV_PASSWORD=ravi
DEV_DATABASE=todo
DEV_HOST=db
DEV_DIALECT=postgres

DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:ravi@db:5432/wd-todo-dev
```

DATABASE_URL: This variable holds the connection URL for your development database.

## Production Environment:
  NODE_ENV: Specifies the environment as production.
  PROD_USERNAME: Username for accessing the production database.
  PROD_PASSWORD: Password for accessing the production database.
  PROD_DATABASE: Name of the production database.
  PROD_HOST: Hostname of the production database server.
  PROD_DIALECT: Specifies the dialect for the production database (e.g., postgres).

## Development Environment:
  DEV_USERNAME: Username for accessing the development database.
  DEV_PASSWORD: Password for accessing the development database.
  DEV_DATABASE: Name of the development database.
  DEV_HOST: Hostname of the development database server.
  DEV_DIALECT: Specifies the dialect for the development database (e.g., postgres).

In both environments, we are using PostgreSQL as the database.
The variables for username, password, database name, host, and dialect are used for configuring the database connection.

## PM2 Cluster Mode Deployment

```
module.exports = {
  apps: [{
    name: "app",
    script: "./index.js",
    instances: "max",
    exec_mode: "cluster",
  }]
}
```
This file specifies how PM2 should manage Node.js application.

  1. module.exports: This statement exports an object containing configuration options for PM2.
  2. apps: An array containing configuration options for individual applications managed by PM2.
  3. name: Specifies the name of the application. In this case, it's set to "app". You can change it to any desired name.
  4. script: Specifies the entry point of your Node.js application. Here, it's set to "./index.js", indicating that PM2 should start the application by running index.js file. You may need to adjust the path according to your project structure.
  5. instances: Specifies the number of instances of the application to run. Setting it to "max" instructs PM2 to spawn as many instances as there are CPU cores available.
  6. exec_mode: Specifies the execution mode for your application. Setting it to "cluster" enables PM2 to run your application in cluster mode, distributing incoming connections across multiple instances.

```
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
```
This command will start your application named "app" with the settings specified in the ecosystem.config.js file.

## Security Measures

1. Securing Environment Variables:

  1. Store sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, and other secrets as environment variables.
  2. Avoid hardcoding sensitive information directly into your codebase.
  3. Use a .env file to manage environment variables during development.
  4. Ensure the .env file containing sensitive information is added to .gitignore to prevent accidental exposure in version control systems.
  5. Utilize a library like dotenv to load environment variables from the .env file into your Node.js application.
  6. Consider using a secrets management service for more secure storage and retrieval of sensitive information, especially in production environments.

2. Employing HTTPS:
  1. Use HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between your Node.js application and clients.
  2. Acquire a valid SSL certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). This can be obtained through services like Let's Encrypt, or you can purchase one from a CA.
  3. Configure your Node.js server to use HTTPS. This typically involves creating an HTTPS server instance using Node.js's built-in https module or using a reverse proxy like Nginx or Apache with SSL termination.
  4. Enable HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) to instruct browsers to only connect to your application over HTTPS.
  5. Consider implementing secure headers such as Content Security Policy (CSP), X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, and X-XSS-Protection to enhance security further.
