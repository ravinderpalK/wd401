### Automatic Test Suite Execution on GitHub:

1. Create Workflow File: Inside your GitHub repository, create a directory named .github/workflows if it doesn't exist already. Then, create a YAML file within this directory to define your workflow. You might name it something like test.yml or ci.yml.
2. Define Workflow Steps: In the YAML file, define the steps necessary to execute your test suite. This typically involves checking out the code, installing dependencies, and running tests. Here's a basic example for a Python project using pytest:
3. Commit and Push: Commit the workflow file to your repository and push it to GitHub.
4. Enable GitHub Actions: If you haven't already done so, enable GitHub Actions for your repository by going to the "Actions" tab in your repository and following the prompts to enable workflows.
5. Monitor Execution: Once GitHub Actions is enabled, it will automatically execute the workflow defined in your YAML file whenever there's a push or pull request to the specified branches. You can monitor the execution of your test suite directly within the GitHub interface.
6. View Results: After the workflow execution completes, you can view the results, including any failing tests or errors, directly within the GitHub Actions tab or in the pull request checks.

### GitHub Actions Walkthrough:

1. Access Your GitHub Repository
2. Create a Workflow Directory : If you don't already have a directory for workflows, create one named .github/workflows in the root directory of your repository. 
3. Create a Workflow File: nside the workflows directory, create a new YAML file to define your workflow. You can name this file anything you want, but a common convention is to name it something like main.yml or test.yml. For example, .github/workflows/test.yml.
4. Define Workflow: Edit the YAML file you created and define the workflow.
5. Commit Changes
6. Push Changes
7. Enable GitHub Actions: If you haven't already done so, go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository and follow the prompts to enable workflows.
8. Monitor Execution
9. View Results 

### Conclusion:

- Demonstrates a robust testing setup with Jest, Supertest, and Cypress.
- Automatic test suite execution on GitHub using GitHub Actions ensures continuous testing.

### jobs:

1. **run-tests**: This job is responsible for running tests on the application, including unit tests and integration tests. It ensures that the application behaves as expected and meets quality standards before deployment.

2. **deploy**: This job is responsible for deploying the application to a production environment. It deploys the application if the tests from the run-tests job are successful.

3. **notify**: This job sends notifications to Slack to inform about the status of the CI/CD process. It notifies about the success or failure of both the test execution and the deployment.

The workflow is triggered on every push to the wd201 repository.
These jobs orchestrate the CI/CD process, ensuring that the application is thoroughly tested and deployed to production with appropriate notifications at each stage.

## Env Variables

```yaml
env:
  PG_DATABASE: "${{ secrets.POSTGRES_DATABASE }}"
  PG_USER: "${{ secrets.POSTGRES_USER }}"
  PG_PASSWORD: "${{ secrets.POSTGRES_PASSWORD }}"
  MY_RENDER_SERVICE_ID: "${{ secrets.MY_RENDER_SERVICE_ID }}"
  MY_RENDER_API_KEY: "${{ secrets.MY_RENDER_API_KEY }}"
  SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: "${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}"
```

1. PG_DATABASE, PG_USER, PG_PASSWORD:
  Purpose: These variables are used to configure the PostgreSQL database connection for running tests. They specify the database name, username, and password.
  Usage: They are populated with corresponding secrets stored in GitHub Secrets. These secrets should be set up in the repository settings with appropriate values.

2. MY_RENDER_SERVICE_ID, MY_RENDER_API_KEY:
  Purpose: These variables are used to authenticate and configure the deployment action to Render, a hosting platform.
  Usage: They are populated with the Render service ID and API key, respectively, stored as GitHub Secrets. These secrets are required for the deployment action to authenticate and deploy the application to Render.

3. SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL:
  Purpose: This variable is used to configure the Slack webhook URL for sending notifications.
  Usage: It is populated with the Slack webhook URL stored as a GitHub Secret. This secret should be set up in the repository settings with the webhook URL obtained from Slack.

Overall, these environment variables help configure the workflow to interact with external services securely. By using secrets stored in GitHub Secrets, sensitive information such as database credentials and API keys are kept confidential and are only accessible to authorized users and services.
